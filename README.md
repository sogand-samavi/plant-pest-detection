# plant-pest-detection

Project Overview
* This project aims to detect and identify plant pests using images of plants. The system leverages image processing and YOLO (You Only Look Once) for pest detection. The output provides the location and type of
* insects on the plant. This project can assist farmers and plant health experts in timely pest control and reducing crop damage.

Features
* Accurate detection of plant pests in color images.
* Utilizes the YOLO model for fast and precise detection.
* Can be applied to new images without retraining the model.
* Outputs include the type of pest and its coordinates on the image.

Dataset
* Contains images of plants with various pests.

Technologies Used
* Python
* OpenCV
* YOLO (You Only Look Once)
* NumPy / Pandas

Notes
* This project focuses only on insect detection and does not cover plant diseases.
* Accuracy can be improved by adding more dataset samples and data augmentation techniques.
